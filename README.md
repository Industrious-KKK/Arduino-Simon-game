This is a LED and Punch Button based interactive game. 
Makes a perfect little project to get started in IOT

Requirements:
    1) Arduino UNO
    2) 6 LED(s) ( 4 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Green )
    3) 4 Punch Buttons

How to setup:
    Follow the Circuit Diagram From Circuit.png.
    The connections are pretty Easy.
    Connect the Arduiono to computer and Upload the code.
    Additional updates will me made to the project throughout the
    dev, but the core circuit diagram will remain the same.
    ( Do check the port before uploading from tools > port )
    Connect the com port to the arduino and then load the code
    of the game.

    
Game-play:
    Once the game starts, the led's will blink on and off
    in a particular combination one by one. Once they stop, 
    you have to press the the buttons in the same combination 
    which will set them on/off in the same pattern.
    
    Green light indicates that the correct pattern has been 
    entered an you proceed to the next pattern
    
    Red light indicates you have entered the incorrect pattern
    i;e game-over.
    
    With each level, the pattern will become more and more difficult 
    to follow.

Additional components: 
    Since the project is in development stage, more features
    can be added.
    Example an LCD screen indicating score and current level etc.
